# Reference Deployment

## 1. Description

The reference deployment application is to demonstrate a collection of F Prime components interconnected to form a deployment. The deployment represents a "reference" spacecraft that includes commanding, events, telemetry channels and parameters.

## 2. Topology

The topology of the reference example is the interconnection of all the components used in the reference deployment (a deployment is a set of components connected together and compiled into a binary). There are a large number of connections so it is not feasible to show them all in one diagram. The following sections have views of the topology that show the connections for a particular purpose. The topology diagrams will be broken down into the core set of Command and Data Handling (C&DH) connections that would be reused from project to project as well as the connections unique to the reference example.
